Networking Pre Study


blue space all friendlies, mapping and networkinginto red space which is the opposition.

    ##FUNDAMENTALS

Binary     Hex     Decimal


packets, headers, and their sizes:
32 bits is known as a word
4 bytes make up a word ( 4 bytes in an ip4v address)
first byte in an ip header length is 45
double word 64 bits
quad word 128 bits

if you see base 64 try to decode it
only reason for base 64 here is encode or decode.

Encapsulation and decapsulation

please do not throw sausage pizza way ( pdntspa )

sox proxy is used to maintain and push protocols through an established session
proces includes stripping and adding info to packet header in order to tell where it is going.

Layer 1 PHYSICAL
Layer 2 DATA LINK Layer (arp, vlan, and ethernet)
    -sublayers  (MAC media access control (layer 2 to layer 1) and LLC Logical Link Control)
    -switch looks at just the destination mac to send it out faster only looking at 6 bytes compared to looking at 14 bytes ( cut through forwarding)
  -if you see hex dd hex ipv6, if you see hex 8100 it will be standard vlan tag, hex 88a8 nonstandard vlan tag
