Networking Pre Study


blue space all friendlies, mapping and networkinginto red space which is the opposition.

    ##FUNDAMENTALS

Binary     Hex     Decimal


packets, headers, and their sizes:
32 bits is known as a word
4 bytes make up a word ( 4 bytes in an ip4v address)
first byte in an ip header length is 45
double word 64 bits
quad word 128 bits

if you see base 64 try to decode it
only reason for base 64 here is encode or decode.

Encapsulation and decapsulation

please do not throw sausage pizza way ( pdntspa )

sox proxy is used to maintain and push protocols through an established session
proces includes stripping and adding info to packet header in order to tell where it is going.

Layer 1 PHYSICAL
Layer 2 DATA LINK Layer (arp, vlan, and ethernet)
    -sublayers  (MAC media access control (layer 2 to layer 1) and LLC Logical Link Control)
    -switch looks at just the destination mac to send it out faster only looking at 6 bytes compared to looking at 14 bytes ( cut through forwarding)
  -if you see hex dd hex ipv6, if you see hex 8100 it will be standard vlan tag, hex 88a8 nonstandard vlan tag 

arp used for ip to mac
proxy arp - if router has ip address then router will respond with its mac address
gratuitous arp attack - poison arp cache by sending out a specific malicious host repetitively till something is sent back.
Command: arp -a (shows arp cache) or 'ip neighbor'

IPV4 Header:
DSCP field determines what type of traic it is such as voice (ECN field at tht end is meant for traffic congestion)
Value for DSCP field is the normal value times 4
linux 64
windows 128
cisco 254

Fragmentation Process:
RES DF MF |   Offset
offset changes by taking the data value and divding by 8
for the value defragged will keep adding for what the main value was divided by 

IPV6 Header:

trafic class portion is similar to the dscp field
flow level will tell the which packets need to stay on the same path such as high priority information
hop limit is the same thing as ttl

ICMP Header:

all part of layer 3


Zero Configuration Networking:

Ipv4 auto configuration
-APIPA
-RFC 3927 
IPv6 auto ocnfiguration
-SLAAC (stateless address auto-config)
-RFC 4862

Transport Layer (4):

TCP and UDP

TCP Flags :
CWR, ECE, URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN
Collection of Exceptionally Unskilled Attackers Pester Real Security Folks
(Three Way Handshake)

UDP Headers:

Source, destination, length, checksum each 16 bits
no standardized response through udp
Femeral ports: femeral high port means temporrily open ( short lived only open the amount of time you need to use them)

Session Layer(5):
Socks, NetBIOS, PPTP/L2TP, RPC
                    ^
                VPN Protocol
Socks is used for client server exchange messages

Presentation Layer(6):
translation, formating, encoding, encryption, compression
This layer is for providing information to the user or system in order to coherently run things.
